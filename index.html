            <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p> So we meet again, friends. Good day! I hope you've been having a great week. Though having a great
                week means regular bathroom breaks... and regular bathroom breaks calls for regular cleaning!
                It may sound or look complicated at first, but cleaning a restroom is actually easier and quicker
                than you may think! We can't clean without cleaning supplies, however, so we need to review our
                needed materials.

            <h1> Materials </h1>
            <p> Here is a list of all the materials that I personally use to clean our restrooms. If you already know 
                which brands you trust and often buy from, you can use those instead. Always make
                sure to check the ingredients of cleaning supplies to make sure you're not using something
                you may be allergic/sensitive to!
            </p>

            <h1> Cleaning a Tub </h1>
            <p> When I clean the whole restroom, I usually start with the tub first. </p>
            <h3> Materials Needed </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Ajax Powder Cleaner </li>
                <li> Dish Sponge </li>
                <li> Disinfecting Wipes (optional) </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Step-by-Step Instructions </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Wet the tub you plan to clean with clean water. </li>
                <li> Sprinkle a small amount of the Ajax Powder Cleaner in the inside of the tub (remember:
                    a little Ajax goes a long way! Plus it's expensive so you shouldn't use more than needed). </li>
                <li> Using the dish sponge, scrub the inside of the tub all over, exerting more force on the badly
                    stained areas. Make sure to scrub near the drain. </li>
                <li> (You can use either a sponge or a disinfecting wipe for this step, whichever is easier for you) 
                    If the wall of the tub is tiled, scrub the grout to remove the staining. If you're using Ajax,
                    make sure not to use too much of it, for Ajax contains bleach which could potentially ruin 
                    the caulking of the wall. </li>
                <li> When Ajax dries, it causes the surface it was applied on to become quite dull. Make sure to
                rinse your tub well to keep it looking shiny! </li>
            </ol>
            <p> Congratulations! You just cleaned your tub! You can now shower with pride. </p>

            <h1> Cleaning a Toilet </h1>
            <p> Oh... gross. Cleaning a toilet definitely isn't the most desirable task, but it must be done.</p>
            <h3> Materials Needed </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Liquid Toilet Cleaner </li>
                <li> Toilet Scrub </li>
                <li> Disinfecting Wipes </li>
                <li> Paper Towels </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Step-by-Step Instructions </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> I'm not completely sure how necessary this step is, but I and everyone else (who actually cleans)
                    in my family does it, so I'll continue the tradition. Flush the toilet so that the inside of the
                    toilet is wet. </li>
                <li> Once the toilet stops streaming water into itself, pour in a bit of the liquid toilet cleaner 
                    along the rim of the toilet bowl. </li>
                <li> Wait for a small amount of time, like maybe 5 minutes or so (or however long the directions on
                    the bottle say). </li>
                <li> Wielding your sword of humbleness (your toilet scrub), scrub the inside of the toilet bowl, paying
                    extra attention to the well defined stains. </li>
                <li> Once you have successfully scrubbed out the stains, you can put your sword (toilet scrub)
                    back into its sheath (toilet scrub holder) and sit back and admire your work. But you're not done, no. </li>
                <li> Once again, depending on what the liquid toilet cleaner bottle says, you might need to flush the toilet
                    right away or wait a few more minutes. </li>
                <li> You're almost done, don't worry. Grab a disinfecting wipe and begin wiping all around the outside
                    of the toilet. Always start from the top and work your way to the bottom (since the bottom will
                    probably be more stained than the top). </li>
                <li> When you've finished wiping the toilet, grab a paper towel and dry the toilet. </li>
            </ol>
            <p> Yay, you! You've cleaned your toilet! The next two things aren't half as gross as cleaning a
                toilet (well, maybe it is depending on how bad your restroom is).

            <h1> Cleaning a Sink </h1>
            <p> This is incredibly easy, relax! (No seriously, it is.) </p>
            <h3> Materials Needed </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Disinfecting Wipes </li>
                <li> Ajax (optional) </li>

            <h3> Step-by-Step Instructions </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Grab a disinfecting wipe and wipe down the sink. Be sure to wipe the sink faucet! </li>
                <li> Depending on how dirty the inside of the sink is, you may want to use a sponge and a
                    teensy bit of Ajax to clean the inside of it. </li>
                <li> Dry the sink using a paper towel. </li>

            <h1> Cleaning a Mirror </h1>
            <p> You're almost done, mate! Keep going! </p>

            <ul>
                <li> Windex Glass Cleaner </li>

            <h3> Step-by-Step Instructions </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Spray some Windex on the glass and immediately wipe it off with a paper towel. </li>
                <li> Continue this for the entire mirror, until you don't see any more spots. </li>
                <li> Tip! If you notice that the Windex leaves cloudy streaks on the mirror, use a
                    <span id="buld">dry</span> paper towel and a lot of elbow grease to rub it off. </li>
